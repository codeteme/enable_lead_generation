# Qatar Restaurant List for B2B Lead Generation
Compile a list of restaurants in Qatar for B2B lead generation

<strong> Objective </strong>
The purpose of this project is to create a tool that compiles a comprehensive list of restaurants in Qatar that offer delivery, for B2B lead generation.

<strong> Data Sources </strong>
The following data sources have been used to compile the list:

Talabat: provides a list of companies in Qatar that offer delivery services. However, it includes non-food vendors such as flower shops and pharmacies, so these will be excluded from the final list.
Google Maps: The Google Maps API is used to count the number of branches of each restaurant.
MyBookQatar: This mobile app indicates the number of branches each brand has.
Snoonu: This source contains a category called fine dining, which will be used to filter the “big” list.
Open Table: This source is used to estimate the price range to filter for fine dining restaurants.

<strong> Example </strong>

Talabat = 3,317 are non-food vendors such as flower shops, and pharmacies  
Google Maps = 120restaurants has only 1 branch 
MyBookQatar = 50 restaurants has only 1 branch 
Snoonu = 300 restaurants are fine dining 
Open Table = 100 restaurants are fine dining 

Total number of restaurants: 3,317 - 120 - 50 - 300 - 100 = 2,747
